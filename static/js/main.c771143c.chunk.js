By having multiple minigames that focus on different speech problems, children can exercise and practice their speech everyday while also having fun.

The quirky characters and calm voice acting cater to young children that it does not feel like an educational game. Throughout the project, I worked with the team to analyze users through BORIS, which is a tool that allows the researcher to watch the captured video feed and digitally make notes by using key codes. I also collaborated and pair-programmed with other team members to create a minigame and surveys. One of the problems of the speech-recognition system was that it would not detect high-pitched, female voices, which was ironic since it was targeted to children.
