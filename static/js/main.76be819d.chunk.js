I wanted to create a fast-paced game where the player feels a sense of agency and stress while completing the goal. I enjoy games where the player must beat themselves by getting a better score than their last one. The game has replayability, and the falling platforms and amount of time the player has to collect as much steak as they can are randomized, so different playthroughs may be more stressful than others."},{"image":"http://jcamingue.weebly.com/uploads/9/8/9/5/98950030/yerbamatesprototype1coverphoto_orig.png","title":"Daikon Druid","summary":"Daikon Druid is an adventurous and fun 8-bit pixel game made in Unity where the player controls a magical druid wandering through a forest and interacting with their surroundings.","media":{"type":"img","src":"http://jcamingue.weebly.com/uploads/9/8/9/5/98950030/yerbamatesprototype1coverphoto_orig.png"},"desc":"Daikon Druid is an adventurous and fun 8-bit pixel game made in Unity where the player controls a magical druid wandering through a forest and interacting with their surroundings. The game tests for different reactions from players when certain events occur based on the player\'s choices. It originally looks like a standard Legend of Zelda RPG, but as the player keeps on playing, they realize that the user interface is actually unimportant. For example, there are enemy AIs, which are the bears. When the player is in close proximity with the enemy, this causes the player to feel uncomfortable due to them losing health, but as the health bar depletes to zero, the enemy goes back to its idle position, and the player is still alive instead of being dead like in traditional games. Also, as the player clicks on the user interface icons like the bag to check what is inside, they realize that the bag is not clickable as well as the other icons. My team and I created this game in about three weeks. Yerba Mates, our team, was consisted of eight people, including me. I was a gameplay programmer and worked on the enemy AI, player interactions, brainstorming, and version control."},{"image":"http://jcamingue.weebly.com/uploads/9/8/9/5/98950030/endlessmode_orig.png","title":"Trash Toss","summary":"Trash Toss is an educational mobile game that was made using Unity.","media":{"type":"img","src":"https://html2-f.scribdassets.com/4s7hf6tzcw6eo7wh/images/1-23e1995013.png"},"desc":"Trash Toss is an educational mobile game that was made using Unity.

The game teaches players what to recycle and the consequences for recycling the wrong item. The simple UI reflects waste management and real life conflicts like how money is lost when the wrong item is put into the wrong bin. I was a software engineer and game designer on the team. I worked on fixing bugs, implementing new features, and creating the complex items using Adobe Illustrator, Pixlr, and Inkscape. I was on the Computer Science team, and I worked closely with the Outreach side of the Trash Toss team to get information and implement it in the game.

For instance, the staff have been replaced with the wizard\'s henchmen. The minigames look creepier as well. There are multiple endings. One is where the player gets enough tickets, dies in a minigame, and when the player does not get enough tickets in time.
